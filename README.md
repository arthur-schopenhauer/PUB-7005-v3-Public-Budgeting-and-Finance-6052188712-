# To View the Diagrams
Although I included the statis page in the assignment it may not display properly in some browsers. If that happens to view the chart and its annotations, It is possible to download the [Bar Chart](https://github.com/arthur-schopenhauer/PUB-7005-v3-Public-Budgeting-and-Finance-6052188712-/blob/main/BarChart.html) file  above by clicking on the link. Once downloaded to the Downloads folder of your computer open it in a web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari). Thank you, Dr. Biddle for this opportunity. -G.
